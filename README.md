Typescript Playground is a Firefox extension that brings the Typescript
to-JavaScript compiler handy for snippets on the web.

# Contributing

Kindly submit any issues or feature suggestions you have. Code
contributions are also welcome.

For helping with code, you will need to install and be familiar with:
* Git
* Firefox Add-on SDK

# Install

Install from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/typescript-playground/
or drag <code>typescript-playground.xpi</code> to Firefox's Add-on Manager.

# Use

Simply find a TypeScript sample, select the code, right click the selection and 
click on "TypeScript to JavaScript". That was easy.

As of 0.1, you no longer get an extra context menu item for sites other than
those having "typescript" and/or ".ts" in their URL. This is to reduce clutter.

1.1.2 also enables the context-menu for pages whose URL does not mention either 
"typescript" or ".ts", but "typescript" is mentioned in the page's title.

N.B.: The search for these keywords is case-insensitive.
